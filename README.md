# Chocolate Chip Cookies
1 cup unsalted butter - softened to room temp
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup brown sugar
2 large eggs
1 Tablespoon vanilla
2.5 cups all-purpose flour - plus 2 Tablespoons
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon cornstarch
2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
sprinkle of kosher salt - add after baking
Instructions
Cream butter and sugars together in a large standing mixer. Add the eggs, and vanilla, and mix well.
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and cornstarch. Add to the mixer until JUST combined. Don't over-mix.
Mix the chocolate chips by hand (using your actual hands to mix them in!). Place cookie dough in an airtight container, and store in refrigerator for at least two hours. Roll into 22 balls.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare baking sheets with parchment paper. Place cookie balls in the freezer for about 30 minutes prior to baking.
Bake for 10-13 minutes, or until tops are starting to turn golden brown. Sprinkle with some kosher salt.
Let cookies rest for five minutes before removing to cooling racks.
